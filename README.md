# ReTech---Reusable-Tech-for-better-Tomorrow

ReTech is a community-centric web platform designed to bridge the digital divide by
enabling the donation and reuse of electronic devices. The project promotes digital
inclusion while encouraging sustainable e-waste management by extending the life cycle of
unused technology.
